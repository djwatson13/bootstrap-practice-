        I recently qualified for my Bachelor's in Music Performance- Trombone from Louisiana Tech University. <br>
        I do not wish to share my face or other personal information for this project.

  <footer>
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">Nothing was told to be put in the footer tag, so I will just say how I think CodeX needs to reevaluate its use of promoting AI usage in this class as it is a soulless, disgusting practice that makes me not want to finish this course and its celebration and promotion have caused me to stop attending classes altogether. Also your assignments need some double checking as, again, nothing was specified to be put in this footer, among other issues with typos and lack of clear direction or relevant content.</p>
